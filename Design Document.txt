Design Document v.1.0

SUMMARY

   This website will allow Rowan students to buy, sell and trade their used textbooks to other students. 
   
   It will have a "single page application" design in which the user will navigate the website without having to load an    
   entire webpage when they click on a link or button within the website. 
   
   The 'index.html' file that contains the buttons and navigation will persist, while the body of the webpages will be 
   populated with the code within the partials. The partials include html files such as 'browse.html', 'post.html', 
   'about.html', 'contact.html', etc. that contain only the functional code within their respective uses.
   
   There will also be a notification system that allows for users to send an e-mail or notification to the seller or
   trader in order to contact them to discuss about a possible deal.

<h2 align="center">The Idea</h2>
    <p align="center"> Buying textbooks from the bookstore can be outrageously priced. This website will
    allow Rowan students to buy, sell, and trade their used textbooks to other students. This will
    provide an affordable alternative to the bookstore or purchasing through online sources. This site
    should also create a sense of community between Rowan students as they will be interacting and
    helping each other by the exchange of books.
